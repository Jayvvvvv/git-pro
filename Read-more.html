    How did we ever manage to cook before the arrival of the internet? I suppose we had to rely on cookbooks, cooking tv
    shows, and knowledge handed down from our grandmothers. Of course, the more daring would experiment in the kitchen,
    remembering the successes, and mercifully forgetting any culinary disasters.
    Nowadays we have a multitude of food blogs offering mouth-watering recipes, suggestions, and vivid photography,
    sending us straight to the kitchen â€¦ or the supermarket. There are hundreds of food blogs to tempt your taste buds.
